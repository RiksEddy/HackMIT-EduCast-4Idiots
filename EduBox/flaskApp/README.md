# Flask App - EduBox Hosts a Basic Web Page for uploading files from Browser

## Very simple web app with three key features:
* Form field in HTML to upload media of specific type (i.e. PDF, mp4, etc.)
* Routing to other sample html pages that were initially built
* Our beautiful EduCast logo on the HTML Page thanks to Dhyey Gandhi
